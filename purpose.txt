toothpick frame made of bamboo sticks and maybe other wood
goal is to be light weight and CHEAP as SHIT
project should have all the information and files to allow anyone with access
to a cnc laser or router to fabricate the frame
eventually have multiple formats of files ie pdf, gcode, etc for more universal
access
