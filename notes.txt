first cuts:	for the center joint a 2.omm notch seems the best. after filing
		the joined pieces were close to even. might experiment with 2.1-
		2.2mm notch. motor mount point seemed like 1.5mm was best but
		cant be sure until I have motors to test with. the holes were
		drilled off center because I didn't properly align the pieces in
		the jig. plan to make the jig idiot proof for next go. there was
		a lot of moisture in the bamboo, not sure if drying them out
		more would help get better cuts on the laser. or maybe it will
		cause the wood to warp more.
second cuts:	this time the holes were unaligned on the other axis and i
		accidentaly had the motor mount depth at 2.0mm instead of 1.5mm
		I assume the misalignment was caused by not placing the jig in
		the corner properly. maybe change jig to have all sides cut and
		a gap in the corner to avoid corner issues. don't need to recut
		the trimming jig but do need to recut the main jig. 2 sticks
		weigh 3.9g (compare to kabab toothpick 10.4g @ $16.00)
